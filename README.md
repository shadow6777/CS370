# CS370
My CS370 intelligent agent project

Reflection:
The code I created myself was after the psuedocode section which implemented the deep Q learning for the agent.
Computer scientists have many different responsibilities depending on what their job title/concentration is. A computer scientist who concentrates on software engineering for example would be responsible for coding/programming things such as an intelligent agent as I did for the CS370 class or programming a website or even a video game.
There are many approaches to problems as a computer scientist that also depends on the problem, thinking thoroughly is an important first step to problem solving for a computer scientist as normally the problem might be something overlooked such as with coding you may have missed capitilazing a letter or missed a semi-colon.
My ethical responsibility to an end user would be to ensure their information stays private and that they are not discrimated against in any way.
